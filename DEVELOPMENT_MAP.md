# TradeCircle Code Map

Use this guide to find the file that owns a feature before changing it.

## Frontend

- `Frontend/Public/index.html` — Page structure, forms, dashboard panels, IDs, and navigation buttons.
- `Frontend/Public/style.css` — Layout, colors, responsive behavior, and visual states.
- `Frontend/Public/script.js` — Browser behavior, API calls, login routing, dashboard navigation, rendering, and event handlers. New orders show each supplier's payment methods and instructions; buyers report payments and suppliers confirm receipt.

## Backend

- `Backend/server.js` — Express setup, middleware, API registration, static frontend hosting, and server startup.
- `Backend/routes/auth.js` — Registration, sign-in, session creation, logout, and account actions.
- `Backend/routes/admin.js` — Admin-only APIs for accounts, products, supplier verification, orders, payments, group deals, and activity.
- `Backend/routes/sales.js` — Sales-employee APIs for buyer accounts, real order/payment history, private follow-ups, RFQs, and internal quote tracking.
- `Backend/routes/products.js` — Public product listings and supplier product management.
- `Backend/routes/orders.js` — Buyer orders, supplier fulfillment and payment settings, per-supplier order payments, buyer payment reports, and supplier receipt confirmation.
- `Backend/routes/deals.js` — Group-buy requests, deals, participants, and joining a deal.
- `Backend/routes/payments.js` — Legacy M-Pesa checkout and callback verification for older orders.
- `Backend/middleware/auth.js` — Signed-in, role, and terms-acceptance checks.
- `Backend/database/schema.sql` — PostgreSQL tables, columns, constraints, and indexes.
- `Backend/database/migrations/001_sales_workspace.sql` — Repeatable migration that adds the sales role, follow-up/RFQ/quote tables, and admin access audit records.
- `Backend/database/migrations/002_supplier_payments.sql` — Repeatable migration for supplier payment preferences and per-supplier order payment tracking.

## Common Changes

- Change dashboard text or add a panel: update `Frontend/Public/index.html`, then wire rendering and navigation in `Frontend/Public/script.js`.
- Change dashboard appearance: update `Frontend/Public/style.css`.
- Change admin data or access: update the matching handler in `Backend/routes/admin.js`; keep it behind the admin role guard.
- Change sign-in or account roles: check `Backend/routes/auth.js`, `Backend/middleware/auth.js`, and the corresponding frontend flow in `Frontend/Public/script.js`.
- Change product, order, deal, or payment behavior: use the matching backend route file above, then update the frontend that calls it.
- Suppliers configure accepted payment methods and instructions in their dashboard. Buyers pay suppliers directly, report the method used, and suppliers confirm receipt before fulfillment can proceed.
- Add or change persisted fields: update `Backend/database/schema.sql` and the API queries that read or write those fields.
- Apply the sales workspace migration from `TradeCircle/Backend` with `npm run migrate:sales-workspace` before starting or restarting the backend. An admin grants sales access from a buyer account's profile in the account directory.
- Apply the supplier payment migration from `TradeCircle/Backend` with `npm run migrate:supplier-payments` before starting or restarting the backend.
- Sales quotes and RFQs are internal records only; quote sharing is manually marked and no customer or supplier message is sent.

## Run Locally

From `TradeCircle/Backend`, run `npm.cmd start`. The app serves the frontend and API at `http://localhost:3001` unless `PORT` is set.

For a new PostgreSQL database, set `DATABASE_URL` and run `npm.cmd run db:init` from `TradeCircle/Backend` before starting the app. This applies `database/schema.sql` in a transaction. The sales workspace and supplier payment migration commands below are for updating existing databases.

For backend errors, check the terminal running the server. For frontend errors, check the browser developer console. Never put passwords or API secrets in this guide or source files; keep them in the backend environment file.
